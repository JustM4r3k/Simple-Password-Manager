# Simple-Password-Manager
This is simple password manager I made using Tkinter module in python and passwords are saved in .json.

After starting main.py you will see window in which you can either save your data, generate random password or search for your data.

P.S.: You will need python and tkinter module installed(or some python enviroment like pycharm or whatever).
